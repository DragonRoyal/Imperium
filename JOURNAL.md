## **5/24/2025 Log 1 Deciding a Gantry**
Some of the main things I want to keep in mind while deciding a gantry is the cost and the size of the gantry, who wants to play chess on a 5 feet x 5 feet chessboard? 
Before deciding a gantry I wanted to lay out what were the bare minimum requirements my gantry should be able to achieve. 
### *The gantry should:** ###
+ Have high precision ( chess pieces not colliding on each other )
+ Be robust, a chessboard is something that would have belts, motors, pulleys and etc moving all the time, it needs be able to not wear out too soon.
+ Strong enough to support the weight of the electromagnet mechanism
+ High repeatability (be able to return to the same position multiple times
---
**Note**: Precision and repeatability do not need to be on the level of something like a 3D printer for a project such as this. Tolerances can be higher for this gantry as compared to a gantry needed for a 3D printer.

With this information I researched multiple different types of gantries and I landed on the coreXY. A popular and common gantry used in all sorts of projects including 3D printers. Motor control is simple with 2 motors controlling the movement of the gantry, horizontal movement is achieved from both motors spinning in the same direction, vertical by two opposite direction and diagnal movement is done by spinning only one motor.

![CoreXy implementation](https://corexy.com/reference.png)

A corexy gantry is composed of at least 4 pulleys, 2 motors, 3 linear rods ( or guides ) with 2 belts. After picking some choosing some components I designed a implementation of the CoreXy mechanism. I settled on 2 Nema 17 motors and linear rods as my main componenets. I designed 3d printed mounts and pulleys to connect the parts but the implementation had a problem, the gantry was too big, with the COREXY's strengths of  precision and speed was the issue the space needed to accomodate such a large design, my current implementation was already over 600mm width.

After researching different smaller implementations I landed on T-Bot. T-bot is'nt the most common design and you wont see it in designs such as 3D printers because its not necessarily precise or fast enough for a 3D printer but it should work fine for a chessboard. Next session im going to start designing a H-Bot implementation
**Time Spent: 4 hours**

## **5/26/2025 - 5/29/2025 Log 2 Designing my Gantry**
  A T-Bot gantry is really a fork of the coreXY and thus the same principles apply, the belts controlling X and Y direction must be pararell. The design of a T-bot gantry is pretty self explanatory, it looks like a T. The gantry would have 2 linear guides, 2 Nema 17 motors, 8 pulleys and 1 belt. The assembly of this gantry would be more effecient and cheaper since we traded the extra guide and belt for 4 more pulleys. To pick which linear guides I wanted I looked at the specifications and differences between the different MGN## rails. A rail such as MGN12 would be a low profile rail which would handle less load compared to a HGR12. I picked 2 MGN12 Rails which were each 450mm. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/10248ef9-6df5-41af-a390-a7b097f2a167). The holes on the rail are too far spaced apart to just be directly connected so I made a 3d printed adapter to connect the two rails.

  Now, the hard part is actually making the full gantry with the other parts ( belts, pulleys, motors etc ). I made a wood board frame for the components to be placed on top with holes spaced 25mm apart. The first thing I needed was pieces to connect the linear rails with the wooden board. I designed 3 pieces for the two ends of the rail and the center. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/150af9a0-781e-4325-9755-6c5045ff5a60). My vision for the implementation of the T-Bot gantry would be this, the red pulleys are idler pulleys and the blue ones being controlled by the motor. My drawing skills arent the best but it gives a general idea of the layout of the gantry, **note** the belts in the actual design would be pararal or else the tension would not be distributed evenly. I decided on small GT2 pulleys and some slightly bigger ones for the ones attached to the motor. I designed a motor mount and pulley mounts in order to hold the moving and idler pulleys. By convention NEMA 17 motors have the same X-Y dimensions so designing a motor mount was easier than I thought. I also had to design a a additional pulley mount to be connected to the guide rails. The biggest thing with the designing of these componenets are the positioning of the pulleys, the belts **must** be parallel. ![belt offset](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d40e193f-ad65-4821-a7b3-fc9e2b4b0491) This is not my sketch but its good for illustrating that even the belt thickness should be taken in account in this case im using a standard 6mm timing belt. After designing all my compoenents and placing them into a assembly I started making a belt but I constantly ran into issues of my belts not being parallel; sometimes a a pulley would be 2 mm displaced from another pulley, or sometimes I didnt take into account belt thickness but after trial and error I ended up with a parallel design ![Screenshot 2025-05-28 183847](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7df11b3c-aea9-48c8-bc2d-4b395a06463b)... actually I failed to notice the belts were intersecting through the linear guides. But it was'nt a hard fix and I adjusted all my pulleys a few milimeters higher in order to stop the clipping. I still had a few minor issues in my model, most notably different mates that were not fully defined but after fixing all the errors (I hope) I ended up with a finished product. ![Screenshot 2025-05-29 145640](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a4e7998d-85b0-485b-a92c-524842b15279). I still have a little bit of work left to do on some of the models like the pulley mount but the main design is pretty much done. It took me a span of 2-3 days to design the gantry as I ran into lots of different types of issues I never encountered before but some helpful websites that helped me were

## **6/4/2025 Log 3 Making a BOM** ##
  Since parts are accumulating fast and I don't want to lose track of parts I decided to make a BOM with all my parts im currently using. I split my BOM into 4 main parts, Electronics, Hardware, Raw materials and Misc. I decided to also section my BOM off with the type of componenent. A description of it and why I need it, a limk to the part and price by quanitity, quanity and the total price. Because most of my parts are sourced from the same types of manafacturers I added a columm with common manafacturers and totalled up my parts cost with them to save on shipping. Heres a snippet of the general template of the BOM ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f202c501-a7fb-4338-b672-10b389a7d1cb).
Since my chessboard is 490mm x 490mm, instead of having a pcb of that size since it would cost alot I decided to split it up into a 100x400mm pcb, the reason for this is I would be getting 5 boards anyways and now I can use 4 of them saving more money. One thing to note is I did 100x400 instead of 100x500 since the extra 90mm is just the space outside the chess squares. 
I attached a link of my bom [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yp7t6AiXMwJCAfVlhCX7udocGjks9lOOFWkv4rPJByo/edit?usp=sharing).

## **6/4/2025 Log 4 Hall sensor and Magnet Work** ##
One of the most important parts of this project is accurate piece detection. There were 2 main implementations I could have done, magnets under each chess pieces with a matrix of reed switches or a hall sensor implementation. I decided to continue with a hall sensor implementation because unlike reed switches they will turn on and off instantly when my piece is removed. Reed switches suffer from ghosting issues where the switch might not close even after the magnets been removed. The type of hall sensor and how many I use is based on the magnet under each chess piece. Any typical N35 Magnet gives around 3000-4000 Gauss of magnetism but the strength of the magnet decreases exponentially, somewhat like a inverse cube. At just a distance of ~25mm the strength can decrease around 97%, from 2000 gauss to 60 gauss. One thing you might be wondering is where did I get the number 2000 from? Well in theory you would expectequal magnectic strength from all sides but a concept called flux leakage exists, the more 'uneven' a magnet is the more gauss can escape into different directions. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/43577b63-ef96-4ee0-846c-8351a8bcdc00) This graph is a good representation for the rapid decrease in power over distance. The magnet in the picture is the same as the magnet im currently deciding to use for my chess pieces, a N35 magnet with diameter of 0.7 in and a thickness of 3mm. Some potential issues you might be thinking of is maybe the magnets field overlapping into another square and giving a false positive but because of the rapid loss in magnestism ontop of the fact that the hall sensor will be below a 3mm arylic I dont see that happening. A hall sensor I was researching was the KTH-1601, it has 3 different models in the package a throughole componenet and 2 SMD componenets also with 3 different sensitivity options, 22 Gs Vs 33 Gs Vs 46 Gs. At minimum I would need 64 hall sensors (one for each square) but I might need multiple sensors per square if I run into issues of overlapping but thats a issue which can only reliably be tested once the parts arrive. Due to the large amounts of sensors im using SMD componenets and 46Gs version to reduce issues of overlapping, at a distance of 3mm the gauss is still well over 46 meaning it will still be able to detect. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f30cc715-a04e-4347-8025-2b6b94794786) According to the manafactur datasheet (link [here](https://www.sensor-test.de/assets/Fairs/2024/ProductNews/PDFs/KTH1601-Series-Datasheet.pdf)) the sensor is a binary sensor able to detect both south and north pole using a Schmitt trigger to prevent help with flucating values. Since im having 4 pcbs each 100mm by 400mm that means each pcb can encampass 16 sensors, to make wiring easier im going to use 16:1 multiplexer meaning only 1 muliplexer per pcb and I would only need to use 4 pins on my microcontroller.
