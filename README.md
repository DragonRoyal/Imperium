# Imperium

Imperium is a self moving chessboard which controls pieces through a T-BOT gantry moving a electromagnet. Each piece has a magnet underneath and each square has a hall sensor to detect where a piece is. Similar chessboards such as SquareOff exist but ethier they are too pricy or they have a very low quality feel, my version aims to be more budget friendly as well as be a study more robust chessboard you can truly immerse and play with. 

I created this project as a way to strengthen my skills in CAD, PCB design and software with each part of the chessboard having those features. I also want to eventually sell a board like this since there is a large demand, im hoping to build one and keep on refining it until I can sell it. I learned alot about different topics which were totally unrelated to what I thought this project would be like going in, I learned about magnetism and its properties, the UART protcol,  gantry design, and G-CODE.
